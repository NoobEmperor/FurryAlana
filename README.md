Chat, we all knew Alana is a furry.

## About
Id like to start by thanking [Alana](https://www.twitch.tv/smugalana) for having such a pleasant and friendly demeanor. 
Your sense of humor and friendly persona are an oasis during dark times. Im sure many in chat are in the same boat. To them, stay strong, we will make it.
To Alana, IDK if you remember me, [NoobEmperorGaming](https://www.twitch.tv/noobemperorgaming), had commented one day about the expensive nature of vtuber models.
While these models are a form of art and do take much time an skill to make, I commented that AI could cut down on production time and thereby costs.
This project is NOT to be a know-it-all, but rather out of curiosity. Seeing as I have no decernable art skills, 2D expirence, or knowledge of vtubing this could be fun... 
Or go horribly wrong. Best wishes.
